\section*{Introduction}
This chapter tells the story of a very strange person. Always looking for adventures, however, he never came across anything unusual. So, he was bored in life most of the time.

\subsection{Details}
\subsubsection{Age}
His age is $ a - 1980$, here $a$ is today. which is the year in which the Einstein's equation was published, probably. %I, am not sure
The Equation says that every mass can be almost converted to energy with the use of Equation \ref{eq1}

\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
    e = m c^2
\end{equation}

\subsection{Getting out of boredom}
With the passage of time, he realized that life doesnt always give you adventures. Rather, one needs to find adventures in everyday routines.
